  @param[in] Handle      The handle being queried. If Handle is not a valid EFI_HANDLE, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is
                         returned.
  @param[in] Protocol    The published unique identifier of the protocol. It is the callerâ€™s responsibility to pass in
                         a valid GUID.
  @param[out] Interface  Supplies the address where a pointer to the corresponding Protocol Interface is returned. 
                         NULL will be returned if a structure is not associated with Protocol.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS  The entry point is executed successfully.
